Ingredients:
- Any pasta or grain, cooked in an amount that makes sense for who you're feeding
- Any vegetables you like, cooked or raw - I often buy a party veggie tray to use for this, so you get a small amount of a variety of vegetables.  Spinach or other greens also work well.
- Any protein you like - canned or cooked beans or cooked meats, hard-boiled eggs, diced ham, pepperoni, tofu cubes
- Any cheese if you like, cubed, crumbled, or shredded.
- Any "extras" like black olives, chopped green onions, those crunchy fried onion things, "salad topper" mixes, etc.
- Any salad dressing you prefer, or something like pesto or mayonnaise

Directions:
- Cook your pasta or grain.  If you want the pasta bowls to be cool or room temp, rinse in cold water.  If you want the grain cool, spread it out on a large plate or pan to cool.
- While the pasta is cooking, prep other ingredients to bite-sized.
- Let whoever you are feeding mix whatever they like in their bowl with the ingredients you've prepared.
- Top with your dressing of choice.

This is more a "meal idea" than a recipe. As a busy, on-the-go family with some selective eaters and dietary restrictions, this meal is a fast, flexible one that everyone enjoys because they can put what they like in their bowls. It's also a great way to use up leftover ingredients!  You can eat it warm, cold, or room temperature.  It travels well in a jar or container for packed lunches, picnics, on-the-go, or camping.  We just add the dressing right before eating so nothing gets soggy, but clever layering would work, too.
